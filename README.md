## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, set up the database using XAMPP, and run the project in Visual Studio Code.

### Clone the Repository

Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command:

```bash
git clone 'this project repo url'

cd your-repo

Run the Project
Start the live server using your preferred method. If your project includes a specific command for running the server, use that command. Otherwise, you can use the built-in features of Visual Studio Code to start a live server.


Certainly! To import an SQL file into XAMPP using phpMyAdmin, follow these steps:

Start XAMPP:

Ensure that XAMPP is installed on your machine.
Start XAMPP and make sure that both Apache and MySQL services are running.
Access phpMyAdmin:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

Create a Database:

On the phpMyAdmin dashboard, click on the "New" button to create a new database.
Enter a name for your database and choose a collation (usually, you can leave this as the default).
Import SQL File:

After creating the database, select it from the left-hand side menu.
Click on the "Import" tab in the top menu.

Click on the "Choose File" button and select your 2.sql file from your local machine.
Optionally, you can set other import settings, but in most cases, the default settings should work fine.

Click on the "Go" button to start the import process.
Verification:

Once the import is complete, you should see a success message.
You can now see your tables and data in the database you created.
That's it! Your 2.sql file has been successfully imported into your XAMPP MySQL database using phpMyAdmin. Now you can configure your project to connect to this database.
